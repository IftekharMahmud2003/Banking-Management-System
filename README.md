Description	It provides functionalities for account management, transactions, loan processing, and user authentication. The system supports three user roles: Admin, Manager, and Customer, each with specific permissions and access levels.
Key features include:
Account Management: Users can create, view, and edit account details, including account holder name, email, phone number, address, and NID number. Initial deposits are required to open an account.
Transactions: Customers can deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between accounts. Each transaction is recorded and displayed in a mini statement with date and time.
Loan Processing: Customers can apply for loans, while Admins and Managers can approve or reject loan applications. Approved loans are credited to the customer's account.
Authentication: Secure login with role-based access control. Passwords can be updated, and credentials are stored securely.
Data Persistence: Account and loan data are saved to files (accounts.dat and loans.dat) for persistence across sessions.
User Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) built using Swing provides an intuitive and interactive experience, with animations and visual feedback.
